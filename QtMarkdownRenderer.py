	Specialises the Mistune renderer in order to be better compatible with Qt's
	rich text while degrading gracefully with Github's renderer.

	Mistune converts Markdown into HTML. However its choice for the HTML
	elements to use is not always supported by the limited HTML subset that Qt
	can display with its "rich text" rendering. This class makes sure that the
	supported subset of HTML is used.

	This renderer makes sure that the Markdown that gets interpreted by the
	renderer displays correctly on a conventional Markdown parser such as that
	of Github.

	def preprocess_conditionals(cls, markdown):
		"""
		Preprocesses a piece of Markdown so that conditional texts get properly
		parsed.

		This is necessary because Mistune provides two methods to customise text
		parsing, which are both insufficient as far as I could find.
		* A renderer can only process existing syntax and then only processes
		the content of the syntax at hand. Exposed conditional syntax would
		display the content *between* two inline HTML or block HTML bits, which
		are not part of any syntax, so the rendering is not powerful enough to
		choose to render this bit or not.
		* A lexer (or in Mistune v2.0 a plug-in) can define new syntax elements,
		including stuff wrapped by delimiters. However since the HTML comments
		that we are using are already existing syntax elements, this causes a
		clash which makes the lexer or plug-in not function. These elements get
		parsed as HTML.

		There are two possible syntax variations for conditional content. Both
		will look exactly the same in this plug-in, but look differently when
		rendered with a conventional renderer.
		* Content that gets hidden with a conventional renderer looks like this:
		`<!--if variable == value:conditional content-->`
		* Content that gets shown in a conventional renderer looks like this:
		`<!--if variable == value -->conditional content<!--endif-->`

		This syntax contains a condition, in the above example:
		`variable == true`. This condition consists of a variable, a comparator
		and a value. The conditional content is shown only if the condition is
		met. For instance, you could have a condition such as:
		`cura_version < 4.4` which would cause the conditional content to draw
		only if the user is using a Cura version earlier than 4.4.

		This function finds all of the conditional elements in the text, parses
		them and chooses whether to display them or not.
