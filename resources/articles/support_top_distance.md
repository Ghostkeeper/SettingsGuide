This setting configures how much distance is kept between the top of the support and the overhung surface of the model.

The support top distance is the most influential factor in how well the support adheres to the model where the model rests on the support. Increasing the distance makes it easier to remove the support after printing, since it won't adhere well to the printed object. However it will also make the overhang look worse, since it's allowed to sag a few more layers down before resting on the support.
