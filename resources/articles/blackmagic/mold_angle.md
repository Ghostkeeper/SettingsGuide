Mold Angle
====
Similar to the [Make Overhang Printable](../experimental/conical_overhang_enabled.md) feature, this setting modifies the shape of moulds such that it can be printed without support. Only the outside shape of the mould is modified, so the shape of your cast will not be affected.

For some shapes, modifying the outside shape of the mould is not enough to make it print properly. It'll still need support. You can achieve a similar effect by enabling [Conical Support](../experimental/support_conical_enabled.md).
