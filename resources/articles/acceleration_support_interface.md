This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the support interface. The acceleration during the support interface can be set to a different rate than the rest of the support.

If the printer vibrates a lot due to the nozzle accelerating in different directions during the printing of support interface, the interface may not follow the shape of the model very accurately. This can cause the support to attach more to the print in some places, leaving a scar or a dent in the print. In other places, the support may not support the model as well, causing an ugly overhang. Reducing the acceleration can help with this problem, but will increase printing time.
