Minimum Volume Before Coasting
====
This setting ensures that a minimum amount of material is extruded properly before coasting is applied. If the contour is so small that this minimum amount of material is not extruded properly, it will not coast towards the end of the contour.

This is necessary because for very small pieces, if coasting is applied, it will not have time to properly get the material flowing again when moving from one coasted contour to another. This leads to underextrusion very easily. It is better to skip the coasting technique then.

Increasing this setting will reduce underextrusion with very small parts. However it will increase the visibility of the seams for those parts as well.
