Spaghetti Infill Stepping
====
This setting determines whether the infill material will be deposited periodically during printing or all of it will be deposited just before closing up the infill's volume at the top.

If the material will be deposited periodically during the print it will spread out better. It allows the infill to spread into lower creases of the model and will make it more chaotic, which makes the infill more evenly soft in all directions.

However extruding infill more often will take more time. The material flow takes a while to get started and to stop, which causes overextrusion and underextrusion. If the infill is printed with a different extruder, such as a casting nozzle, it will require more tool switching.
