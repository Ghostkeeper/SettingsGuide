WP Flat Delay
====
While printing the horizontal rings of the wire frame, the nozzle will stand still for a fraction of a second at each line segment. This setting configures the duration of that pause. The pause is located exactly where the horizontal ring connects to the saw-tooth pattern beneath it.

By coming to a complete stand-still and pausing for a moment, a small blob of oozed material will appear in the locations where the nozzle pauses. The pressure of the material flow out the nozzle chamber will also push the horizontal ring slightly downwards. This attaches the ring extra well to the saw-tooth pattern underneath it.

The pause adds heavily onto the total printing time. There are many locations where the nozzle will be paused.
