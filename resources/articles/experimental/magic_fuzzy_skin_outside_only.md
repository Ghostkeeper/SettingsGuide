A fuzzy skin may be a nice effect to give the model some texture or increased grip, but it completely destroys any dimensional accuracy you might expect from the print. This is a problem if the print needs to be mounted on something, such as a handle or a few screws. For such cases, you can disable the fuzzy skin effect on inside contours of the print, confining it to only the outsides.
