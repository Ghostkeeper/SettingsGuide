Fuzzy Skin Thickness
====
This setting determines how wide the nozzle will jitter back and forth while printing the outer wall if [Fuzzy Skin](magic_fuzzy_skin_enabled.md) is enabled.

Increasing the fuzziness will make the surface rougher. Reducing the fuzziness will make the surface more close to the original. Taken to the extreme, a high fuzziness results in a hairy print. The outer wall will then essentially be a random string around your object.
