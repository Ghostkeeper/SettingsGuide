Wipe Repeat Count
====
This setting configures how often the nozzle will be wiped off the brush during every wipe procedure. The nozzle will move back and forth across the nozzle until it's passed this many times.

The initial travel moves to and from the wiping positions are not counted in this setting, but the [initial position](wipe_brush_pos_x.md) is always beyond the brush. As such, the nozzle will also be wiped an extra two times before and after wiping back and forth on the brush.

Brushing more often will make the wipe procedure more effective at removing all remaining material from the nozzle. However it will also take more time and allow the material to ooze more out the nozzle during the wiping procedure.
