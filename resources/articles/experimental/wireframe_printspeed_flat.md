This setting specifies how fast the nozzle will move horizontally while printing the horizontal rings of the wire frame. The speed of the horizontal lines can be configured separately from the rest of the wire printing speed.

The very lowest horizontal layer will be printed at the [Bottom Speed](wireframe_printspeed_bottom.md). That can be configured separately.

Printing slower will take more time, but gives the material more time to solidify. This improves the bridging capacity of the material, which makes the print more reliable and look better in the end as well.
