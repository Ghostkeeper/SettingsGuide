This setting controls the fan speed during bridging of both the walls and skin. This fan speed overrides the normal [fan speed](../cooling/cool_fan_speed.md) that would otherwise be used.

Normally you'll want the fan speed to be turned up as high as possible during bridging. The fan speed will need to be higher than for the rest of the print. This prevents sagging, as the material can solidify more quickly.

However for some high-temperature materials, turning the fan up high can cause underextrusion or even complete clogging of the nozzle.
