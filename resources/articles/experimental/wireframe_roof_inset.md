Where the surface of the model is horizontal, such as the top side of the model, a series of concentric rings will be printed and connected with a saw-tooth pattern. This setting determines the distance between these concentric rings.

A saw-tooth pattern is drawn between each concentric inset. The saw-tooth pattern will not only have the height indicated by this setting, but the base width of the saw tooth pattern as well. The diagonal line will be placed on a distance from the base of the straight line at a distance as indicated by this setting on the innermost ring. As such, this setting indicates the overall density of the roof pattern, not just the distance between the insets.

Reducing this setting places the concentric insets closer together and increases the general density of the pattern. This reduces the distance that the material has to bridge when crossing over the top side of the model. That improves reliability, increasing the chance that a proper connection is made between every single inset.
