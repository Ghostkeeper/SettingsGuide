Contours that are shorter than the [Small Feature Max Length](small_feature_max_length.md) can be printed at a reduced speed. With this setting, you can indicate the speed at which these contours should be printed on the first layer, as a factor of their [normal printing speed](../speed/speed_wall.md). This can be configured separately from the print speed of small features on the [rest of the layers](small_feature_speed_factor.md).

Small contours don't have a lot of surface area to stick to the build plate. Especially when [printing the walls before the infill](../infill/infill_before_walls.md), the walls for small holes are often just tiny circles laying on the build plate. If the nozzle strikes past them in a travel move later, they might get torn off the build plate. For this reason, the printing speed of these small contours can be reduced compared to the other contours. This allows the material to flow out more and fuse to the build plate better, reducing the chance to pull them off the build plate.

Reducing the printing speed of these small contours has a very minor negative impact on the printing speed. Luckily, since these contours are small by definition and it only concerns the first layer, the total added print time is not significant.
