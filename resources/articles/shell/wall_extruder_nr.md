If your printer has multiple extruders, you can choose to print just the walls with a different extruder.

![The walls are printed in blue, but the rest in orange](../images/wall_extruder_nr.png)

Printing the walls with a different extruder can have various purposes:
* Just a visual effect by printing the outer wall with a different colour.
* The walls can be printed with a material that achieves better detail but has undesirable strength-properties for the infill.
* The walls can be printed with a flexible material to get a softer texture on your print, and to get more friction / grip.
* The wall can be printed with a material with a lower friction coefficient, to allow moving parts to slide more easily over the surface.
