Connect Top/Bottom Polygons
====
When using a concentric top/bottom pattern (a pattern consisting of closed contours, otherwise known as polygons), connect all contours together such that they form one single path.

This prevents travel moves for the most part. However it creates new sharp corners where the nozzle will have to accelerate and decelerate a lot, which will offset against the win in printing time. The squiggly pattern will also be visible on the outside, which gives an interesting visual effect.

The contours created by [Extra Skin Wall Count](skin_outline_count.md) are not connected.
