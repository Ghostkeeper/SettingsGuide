Since ironing behaves widely different with different materials, this setting allows you to control how fast the nozzle moves during ironing.

The ironing speed is normally significantly slower than the speed at which the skin is printed. This allows the top surface lines to fuse together. However it will also increase the total printing time quite significantly, especially if the line width of ironing is low.
