Ironing places additional lines into the surface, technically overextruding. This setting controls how much gets extruded in this extra pass. The flow is necessary to fill gaps in the surface.

You should put this setting high enough to keep the pressure on the nozzle. This pressure needs to fill the gaps on the top surface. If you have a very rough top surface (due to pillowing or printing fast) you may need to increase this setting.
