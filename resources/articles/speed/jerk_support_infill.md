Support Infill Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the main part of the support. This can be configured separately from the support interface.

For the support infill, carefully going through corners is not important. The support infill doesn't need to be pretty. It simply needs to stay standing. The jerk can be set pretty high then. Generally this makes supports stronger as well as easier to remove, since the extrusion rate will be more constant.

Increasing the jerk too much increases the chance of a layer shift though. It really tests the limits of the motors.
