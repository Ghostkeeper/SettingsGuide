This setting adjusts the overall speeds at which the model is printed.

Since speeds can also be adjusted separately for individual structures of the print, the actual printing speed will still vary. This setting causes the rest of the speeds to adjust by ratio.

This setting is a great influence on the balance between printed part quality and printing time. Increasing the printing speed will reduce the duration of the print, but will increase vibration of the print head. It will also make it more difficult for the feeder to keep up, making the print more sensitive to overextrusion and underextrusion.

When increasing the print speed, it is advisable to increase the material temperature as well. This will make the material slightly more runny, which allows it to flow more easily at greater speeds.

**Increasing the printing speed will not have a large effect if the print has many small details. Acceleration and jerk are the bottleneck then.**
