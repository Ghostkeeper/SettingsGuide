Support Interface Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the support interface. This can be configured separately from the main part of the support.

Normally the support interface can be printed with pretty large jerk values, because it doesn't matter if there is any ringing in the interface or if the extrusion rate is inconsistent. However the support interface is placed quite closely to the actual print and determines how the support attaches to the object. If the interface is printed inaccurately due to vibrations, this can result in scarring because the support attaches too well to the print, or bad overhangs if there is too much of a gap between the support and the model. This can be a reason to adjust the jerk during the support interface slightly lower than during the rest of the support.
