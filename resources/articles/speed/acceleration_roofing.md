Top Surface Skin Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the top surface. The acceleration during the top surface can be set to a different rate than the rest of the skin.

Reducing the acceleration during the top surface can achieve better water tightness while not incurring as large a penalty on printing time as when the entire top side is adjusted.

Reducing this acceleration will also reduce vibrations through the printer. Depending on the build structure of your 3D printer, these vibrations may cause the build plate to vibrate as well which makes the surface uneven. Reducing this acceleration can prevent that.
