Outer Wall Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the outer walls. The acceleration during the outer walls can be set to a different rate than the inner walls.

Adjusting the acceleration here will greatly affect the dimensional accuracy of the print. High acceleration rates cause shock waves throughout the printer. These shock waves can be seen in the print when the nozzle or the build plate vibrates. Because the outer walls are very visible from the outside, it's common to have the outer walls printed with a lower rate of acceleration than the inner walls. This will cause an increase in the printing time though.
