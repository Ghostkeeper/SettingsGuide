Support Roof Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the support roofs. This can be configured separately from the support floors.

The support roof is where the model rests on the support and mostly what counts for creating nice looking overhangs as well as where the support can leave scars. Both of these are a factor affected by the accuracy of printing the support roof. For the support bottom, overhang quality is not an issue, only the scarring. It makes sense to print the support roof a bit more carefully than the floor.

However reducing the jerk doesn't always print better. Increasing the jerk allows for a more constant extrusion rate. Especially for printers where the feeder is behind a long Bowden tube, getting the extrusion rate constant is a greater goal than reducing vibrations.
