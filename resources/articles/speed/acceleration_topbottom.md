Top/Bottom Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the top and bottom sides of the object. The acceleration during the top and bottom sides can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.

Increasing the acceleration rate compared to the rest can save some time. Since the top and bottom sides typically consist of long straight lines, the nozzle can reach great speeds there. The nozzle must also make sharp corners with the typical lines pattern for skin, which requires great acceleration. However increasing acceleration will cause the printer to shake more as well, but the accuracy of the top and bottom sides is not normally a constraint because they are surrounded by walls.
