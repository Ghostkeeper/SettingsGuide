Prime Tower Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the prime tower. This can be configured separately from the rest of the print.

Reducing the jerk reduces the vibrations going through the printer while printing the prime tower. This can reduce the chance of the prime tower toppling over.

In Cura 4.1 or lower, the prime tower jerk has a significant effect if the square prime tower is used, because there are actually corners to take. With a round prime tower, the effect of this jerk setting is negligible since the corners in the prime tower are all very obtuse. There is not much of a direction change, so even a small amount of jerk allows the nozzle to continue at maximum speed.
