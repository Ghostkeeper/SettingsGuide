This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the support roof. The acceleration during the support roof can be set to a different rate than the support floor.

The support roof is more sensitive to inaccurate printing, because it directly affects the overhang quality. Adjusting the support roof to have a lower acceleration rate than the support bottom can give better overhang quality for a similar printing time.
