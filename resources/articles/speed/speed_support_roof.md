Support Roof Speed
====
This setting configures the speed at which the top side of the support is printed, if [Support Roofs is enabled](../support/support_interface_enable.md).

![Various structures printed at different speeds](../images/speed_difference.png)

A higher speed can save some printing time, but will reduce the quality of overhang. Because the printer will vibrate more, the support roof will be printed less accurately and its surface will be less smooth. As a result, the model printed on top of it will be printed less smoothly, especially if the model is printed very nearby, such as when using soluble support.
