Inner Wall Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the inner walls. The acceleration during the inner walls can be set to a different rate than the outer walls.

Adjusting the acceleration here will affect the dimensional accuracy and general smoothness of the print. High acceleration rates cause shock waves throughout the printer. These shock waves can be seen in the print when the nozzle or build plate vibrates. The inner walls are not visible from the outside except on the top and bottom side, but if they are printed before the outer walls, the outer walls get pushed more towards the outside where the inner walls were printed inaccurately. If the outer walls were printed first, the effect of inner wall acceleration is less visible, but still present due to the outer wall re-melting when the nozzle passes over.

It's common to have the inner walls printed with a higher rate of acceleration than the outer walls, to save on printing time, but a lower acceleration rate than the rest of the print.
