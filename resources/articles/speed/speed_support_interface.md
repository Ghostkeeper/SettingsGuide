Support Interface Speed
====
This setting configures the speed at which the top and bottom side of the support are printed, if [Support Interface is enabled](../support/support_interface_enable.md).

A higher speed can save some printing time.

A lower speed can improve the quality of overhangs. It causes the roofs to print more accurately and more smoothly. As a result, the surface on top of the roof will also be more accurate. The release of the support from the model will also be more consistent, leaving less of a scar on the model.

The effect of this setting on the bottom of the support depends on how the material behaves with cooling. It can either increase adhesion or reduce it, depending on whether the material is easy to cool.

If the support is very close to the model, such as for PVA or other soluble support materials, increasing the support speed can also cause the nozzle to overshoot into the model, marring the surface slightly.
