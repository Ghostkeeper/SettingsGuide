This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the support. The acceleration during the support can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.

Increasing the acceleration rate causes the printer to print the support faster in total, but also less carefully. This will reduce the printing time, but increases the chance for the printer to knock over the support as well and will make the support structure weaker. Typically the support is printed at raised acceleration compared to the rest of the print.
