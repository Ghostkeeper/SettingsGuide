Top/Bottom Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the top and bottom sides of the print. This can be configured separately from the rest of the print.

Increasing the jerk for this part of the print will prevent the nozzle from coming to a standstill in the corners between adjacent skin lines. This will allow the line width to be more consistent overall. Increasing the jerk too much though can cause the build plate to vibrate, creating an uneven surface. It could even cause the motors to lose steps, which would cause a layer shift.
