This setting determines how thick the walls of the mould will become. This is only the horizontal direction. The vertical direction will be determined by the [Mold Roof Height](mold_roof_height) setting.

Printing a thicker wall causes the mould to become stiffer, which makes it more resistant to shrinkage of the cast material. However, it also takes more material and longer to print. If the mould is made very thin, it is useful to fill it completely with walls. This allows the outside walls to contribute more towards the stiffness of the inside. The stiffness of the inside walls is what counts the most to counteract shrinkage.
