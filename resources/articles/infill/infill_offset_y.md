Infill Y Offset
====
Normally the infill patterns are centred on the 3D model's centre. This setting, together with the [Infill X Offset](infill_offset_x.md) allows shifting the centre of the pattern. This setting adjusts the Y coordinate of the centre.

When printing with low infill density, you can use this to position the infill very precisely such that the individual infill lines are positioned where the strength is most needed.
