Infill Overlap
====
If the infill overlaps a bit with the walls, it will adhere better to the walls, causing the part to be much stronger. This setting controls how much the infill overlaps the walls.

* Increasing the overlap causes the infill to bond better to the walls, resulting in a stronger part.
* However, it will also cause the infill to shine through the walls, resulting in a pattern on the surface of the print. This reduces the visual surface quality.
