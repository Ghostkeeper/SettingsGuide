Infill Extruder
====
This setting determines which extruder will be used to print the infill material. It is only available for printers with multiple extruders.

![The shell of the model will get printed with the silver material, but the infill gets printed with the blue material](../images/infill_extruder_nr.png)

If your printer can use a different nozzle for each extruder train, printing infill with a bigger nozzle size will increase printing speed and strength without impeding visual quality of the shell.
