This setting will make the nozzle move a little bit further than the end of the infill line with a small travel move. The aim of this small travel move is to wipe off the material onto the wall next to it. This fuses the infill line to the wall better.

While this travel move makes the object stronger, the main disadvantage is that this travel move moves through the wall which leaves a visible mark on the outside of the print. In effect, it makes the infill pattern shine through the shell more.

This only applies to the ends of the infill lines. When using connected infill lines there will be much fewer ends.
