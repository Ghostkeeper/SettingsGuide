This setting causes pieces of support interface to be left out if it is very small. Instead of the support interface, normal support will be printed.

Some materials only extrude well at high flow rates and need some time to get going. If such materials are used for the support interface, they won't be much use for small interface areas. Leaving them out can save a lot of time switching extruders and travelling around and prevents blobs on the surface. Instead Cura will draw normal support, so that the model can be supported better as well.
