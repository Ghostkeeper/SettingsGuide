The widths of the lines of support roof can be configured separately from the widths of the rest of the support lines.

Printing the support roof with slightly thinner lines is often advantageous for the quality of the overhanging surface that it supports, purely through having a smoother top surface above the support interface. Yet it doesn't necessarily increase the adhesion between the support interface and the model, so the support will not necessarily be harder to remove.

However, printing the roof lines too thin will cause uneven extrusion, which reduces the supporting effect of the roof, causing a worse overhang quality. It may also introduce a great change in the flow rate through the nozzle, causing overextrusion when it starts printing support roof and underextrusion when printing whatever comes after the support roof.
