This setting configures how much clearance must be created while travelling for the wipe procedure. This can be configured separately from the ordinary [Z hop height](retraction_hop.md).

During the wiping procedure, the nozzle moves back and forth rapidly. This makes the printer shake violently, which makes the build plate and the gantry system vibrate up and down as well. If the normal Z hop height is configured very tightly, some more space should be taken for the Z hop during the wipe procedure.
