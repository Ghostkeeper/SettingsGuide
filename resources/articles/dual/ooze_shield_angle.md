Ooze Shield Angle
====
The ooze shield will follow the shape of the model. It needs to stay close, otherwise the travel from the shield to the model will ooze new material. But the model may have horizontal surfaces, so that would create steep overhangs in the ooze shield. This setting limits the steepness of the ooze shield so that it doesn't collapse.

![Instead of following the model down the bottom and the top, it doesn't go steeper than the specified angle](../images/ooze_shield.svg)

* A value of 0 makes the ooze shield completely vertical around the entire shape. The lower the angle, the more stable the shield will be.
* A value of 90 makes the ooze shield follow the model exactly. The higher the angle, the better the ooze shield will prevent oozing on the model.
