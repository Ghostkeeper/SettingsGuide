Nozzle Switch Retraction Distance
====
When printing with multiple extruders, the extruders that aren't currently printing will be held on stand-by. The material must be retracted out of the heat zone completely while they are on stand-by, because they will get a lot of time to ooze otherwise.

This setting determines how far the material for this extruder is retracted when the extruder goes into stand-by during an extruder switch. It can be configured separately, because usually the distance to retract is much greater to ensure that the material doesn't keep oozing and degrading in the nozzle chamber while the other extruders are printing.
