Wipe Inactive Nozzle on Prime Tower
====
If this is activated, the printer will wipe off the previous nozzle after priming the next one in the prime tower.

After a nozzle goes on stand-by, it'll still be quite hot for a while. While it is hot, some material tends to ooze out. While priming the next nozzle in the prime tower, it'll have had the chance to cool down a bit so oozing has slowed down. This setting causes the ooze that dribbled out to be wiped off in the middle of the prime tower, so that it doesn't end up on the side of your printed model.
