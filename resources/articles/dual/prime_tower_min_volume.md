Prime Tower Minimum Volume
====
This indicates how much material must be purged every time the extruder switches. The idea is that a certain volume will have oozed out of the nozzle while it was on stand-by. The volume being primed as indicated by this setting is meant to compensate for that.

This setting indicates the minimum amount of material that needs to be purged. The contours of the prime tower will be finished completely though, so more material may be purged depending on how well the volume aligns with the volume of a contour.

The volume may be different for each extruder, so the final tower may have different number of contours for each of the extruders.
