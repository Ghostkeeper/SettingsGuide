Adhesion Tendency
====
This is a descriptive setting, describing a property of the material being used to print. It describes how well the material tends to adhere to itself, mainly how strong the inter-layer adhesion can be.

Currently the only effect of this setting is in the prime tower to determine which material will get used to print the strong outer shell that keeps the tower up. The material with the greatest adhesion tendency will be used to print the outermost shell of the prime tower.

*There is no unit to this setting. It is meant to be a relative property only.*
