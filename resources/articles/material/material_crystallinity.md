Indicates whether the material forms crystal structures when solidifying or not.

This is a descriptive setting only. The material profiles may set this setting to indicate whether their materials are crystalline or not, but the user can't change it. However, a profile may use this property to determine setting values. This allows the same formulas to be used with different materials, making it easier to design profiles and to make profiles work for certain combinations of materials.

**This setting is never visible in the interface.**
