Printing Temperature
====
This refers to the temperature of the nozzle while printing. The printing temperature is one of the most influential settings, because it affects how the material behaves during printing. Even a small different in temperature can have a large effect on how the plastic flows.

Every type of filament has a range of temperatures it can be printed at. This will usually be listed on the box it came in and on the technical data sheet. Increasing the temperature generally makes thermoplastics more fluid. This allows the printer to extrude material faster, because the internal friction is lowered. When printing with large layer heights, wide lines, large flow or great speeds, the temperature needs to be towards the higher end of the temperature range. However, hotter printing also makes the material harder to cool, so this causes overhang to sag more (requiring more support) and causes more stringing.

Setting the temperature too high causes the material to degrade while printing. This can clog your nozzle and potentially damage your printer. Setting the temperature too low causes the feeder to grind on the material, making it stop extruding.
