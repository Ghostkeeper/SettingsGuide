Default Printing Temperature
====
This setting defines the printing temperature that is ideal for the material. Changing the printing temperature in the material manager will actually change this temperature. The actual printing temperature may still vary for different quality profiles. It is uncommon to need to change this setting unless you are using an uncommon material.

This setting is translated through to the other temperature settings that define the extrusion temperatures at various stages during the printing process.
