Shrinkage Ratio
====
This is a descriptive setting, letting Cura know how much the material shrinks when it cools down from the printing temperature to room temperature.

This setting is currently not used for slicing. It is currently only used to display a warning to the user when printing large things if the shrinkage ratio is larger than 0.5%.

In the future, the slicer may be able to use this setting to counteract the shrinkage for better dimensional accuracy.

**This setting is not visible in the list of settings. It is only an internal setting to be overwritten by the material profile.**
