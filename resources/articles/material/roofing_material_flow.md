This setting adjusts the flow rate for the top surface only. The flow rate for the top surface can be adjusted separately from the flow rate of the rest of the top skin.

Adjusting the flow rate during the top surface is a stop gap method to fix problems with extrusion rate or the top surface not being very smooth.

If there is a problem with extrusion rate only during the printing of the top surface, it is better to look at the [temperature](material_print_temperature.md), [line width](../experimental/roofing_line_width.md) and [speed](../speed/speed_roofing.md) combined, to achieve a reliable flow out the nozzle.

If the top surface is not smooth, the [ironing](../shell/ironing_enabled.md) feature is worth a try, but the [line width](../experimental/roofing_line_width.md) setting is also a more effective way to tune the smoothness of the top surface.
