The support floor is an intermediary structure between the support and the model where the support rests on the model. It can be used to provide a more stable base for the support or to make the support easier to remove from the print, leaving fewer scars.

The support floor can be printed more slowly to get more stable support, or using a different material that is easier to remove from the model. This way, not all of the support needs to be printed with this material or these settings, which can save a lot of printing time.

**The support floor is not generated where the support rests on the build plate.**
