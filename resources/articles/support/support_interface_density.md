Support Interface Density
====
This setting specifies how dense the interface between support and the model will be.

Increasing the density of the support interface allows you to achieve a nice surface finish at the overhangs, just as if the entire support was printed with a great density, without needing all that much extra printing time and material. However it will still be harder to remove the support from the model after printing, because the contact area is still increased.
