Support Floor Thickness
====
This setting defines how thick the support floor is, where the support rests on the model.

A thicker support floor increases the effectiveness of the support floor. There will be more material to separate the main support body from the model. If the support floor is printed with a material that detaches easily from the model, there is less chance of the rest of the support still touching the model to leave a scar.

However a thicker support floor will also make more of the support use the more expensive material or slower printing technique. This can make the print take longer to complete or use more expensive materials.
