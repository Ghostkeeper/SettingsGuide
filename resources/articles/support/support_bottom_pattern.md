Support Floor Pattern
====
The pattern with which the support floor will be drawn can be different from the rest of the support.

The support floor needs to bridge well over the model in order to retain control over how much the support sticks to the model, so that it doesn't let go during printing but is still removable when the print is finished. Choosing a pattern that doesn't have many crossings helps to this end, such as concentric or zigzag. Even if those patterns are not as strong structurally, it makes little difference for the overall strength of the support since only the support floor is affected.
