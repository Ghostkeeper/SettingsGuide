Support Brim Line Count
====
This setting adjusts the number of contours that will be drawn inside the support area for the support brim. With more lines, the brim will become wider.

More brim lines will increase the adhesion of the support to the build plate and reduce warping of support. As a result, the support will stand more sturdily, which improves reliability of the print.
