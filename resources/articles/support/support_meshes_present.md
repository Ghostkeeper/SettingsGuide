Scene Has Support Meshes
====
This is not a real setting, but a hidden internal setting that other settings and profiles can use to adjust their profiles based on whether there are any support meshes present in the scene.

Using this setting, Cura can decide to show some support-related settings when you add support meshes to the scene, even if the [support itself](support_enable.md) is not enabled.

You will not be able to adjust this setting. Cura adjusts this setting automatically based on whether there are any support meshes present in the scene.
