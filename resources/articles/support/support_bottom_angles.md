Support Floor Line Directions
====
The support floor is normally oriented to be as perpendicular as possible to the support above it and the model below. If the orientation of the top surface lines or the support lines has been customised, it is a good idea to customise the orientation of the support floor lines as well. This setting allows you to customise the orientation of the support floor lines.

Multiple angles can be filled in for this setting, separated by commas. Cura will alternate these angles across the layers.

The support floor lines will ideally be oriented to be perpendicular to the model lines that they rest on as well as to the support lines that rest on them. Orienting them perpendicularly reduces the distance that these lines have to bridge and thus reduces sagging and improves the stability of the support.
