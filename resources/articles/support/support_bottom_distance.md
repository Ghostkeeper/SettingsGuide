Support Bottom Distance
====
With this setting you can adjust the distance between the bottom side of the support and the model, where the support rests on the model.

If the support is simply printed on top of the model, they will be stuck on there very strongly. It's better to keep some distance. That way, it's easier to break the support off and it will leave less of a scar on your print. Increasing the distance too much will make the support unstable though.

If your support material is soluble, this distance can be left very low. There is no trouble to break it off then, nor does it leave any scars.
