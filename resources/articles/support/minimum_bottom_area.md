Minimum Support Floor Area
====
This setting causes pieces of the support floor to be left out if they are very small. Instead of the support floor, normal support will be printed.

Some materials only extrude well at high flow rates and need some time to get going. If such materials are used for the support floor, they won't be much use for small floor areas. Leaving them out can save a lot of time switching extruders and travelling around and prevents blobs on the surface. Instead Cura will draw normal support, so that the support can be supported better as well.
