Tree Support Trunk Diameter
====
The branches of tree support are made wider on the bottom side as dictated by the [Tree Support Branch Diameter Angle](support_tree_branch_diameter_angle.md), to increase their stability and to make them fuse together. This setting sets a limit to that diameter. It will not get wider than this.

A wider branch becomes sturdier since it has more surface area to connect to the build plate, and more leverage against the lateral forces that the print head subjects the branches to when it hits them. However a very wide branch also has some disadvantages:

* It will take up more space on the build plate.
* It's not able to pass through narrow openings in the print, causing the branch to disappear or to rest on the model instead.
* It sometimes takes more material to print. In some cases it can also reduce the amount of material, since branches can merge together faster.

Reducing the Tree Support Trunk Diameter setting sacrifices reliability, but mainly reduces the size of the print, which makes it easier to print very large objects.
