Tower Diameter
====
Some overhanging parts of the model are very small. The support that would be generated would topple over easily. Instead, Cura generates towers for these pieces that are wider, so they won't topple over.

This setting configures how wide those towers are.

Wider towers take slightly longer to print and consume more material, but they also make the support more sturdy which ultimately improves the reliability of the print.
