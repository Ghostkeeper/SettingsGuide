This setting configures the distance between any two adjacent lines in the support roof pattern, where the model rests on the support.

Reducing the distance between the support roof lines allows you to achieve a nice surface finish at the overhangs, just as if the entire support was printed with a high density, without needing all that much extra time and material. The distance that the model has to bridge will be reduced.

However it will be harder to remove the support from the model after printing, because the contact area is also increased. Reduced line distance is particularly effective with materials that are specialised to be easy to remove from the build material, such as soluble support or materials with great shrinkage ratios.
