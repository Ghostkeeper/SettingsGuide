Z Hop Only Over Printed Parts
====
This setting causes the printer to try to avoid other objects horizontally more often rather than passing over them vertically.

If the [Avoid Printed Parts](travel_avoid_other_parts.md) setting is enabled, the nozzle will avoid other parts when travelling from one place to another. Normally, if a Z hop is applied, avoiding printed parts is not necessary any more. This setting switches that logic around: If avoiding printed parts is not possible, a Z hop is applied.

Z hops can be problematic for the wear of the Z axis of some printers. This setting can reduce the amount of Z hops by going around an object horizontally instead of vertically. For some printers, moving horizontally instead of vertically can also be faster.
