Z Hop Height
====
If a Z hop is performed, this setting determines how high the nozzle will move up before travelling to the destination.

Higher Z hops take more time to do, which increases the total printing time and slightly increases the amount of oozing as well. However passing too low over the surface allows the ooze out of the nozzle to hit the model anyway, defeating the purpose of the Z hop.
