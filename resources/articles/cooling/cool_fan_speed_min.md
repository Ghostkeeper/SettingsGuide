Regular Fan Speed
====
The speed at which the fans on the print head will spin, unless the layer is very small. This is the fan speed that will be used for most of your print, but if the layer is small then the fan speed will be increased towards the [Maximum Fan Speed](cool_fan_speed_max.md) in order to cool the layer faster.
