If enabled, the filament will be retracted when moving to the height of the next layer.

This can be used to reduce the Z seam on the surface. However, it will only be effective if the retraction distance is very low. If the retraction distance is high, the duration of the retraction will allow the material to ooze so much that it counteracts the retraction.
