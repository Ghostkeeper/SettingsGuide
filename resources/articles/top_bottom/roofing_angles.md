Top Surface Skin Line Directions
====
This setting allows you to choose different directions for the pattern in the very topmost layers indicated by the [Top Surface Skin Layers](../top_bottom/roofing_layer_count.md) setting than the rest of the top and bottom.

Only the top layer(s) of the skin will get drawn in these directions. The value for this setting is a comma-separated list of angles in degrees. The directions indicated in this list will be alternated from layer to layer.

The function of this setting is mostly cosmetic. While certain orientations for the lines in the top and bottom pattern may be stronger for your particular part, the impact of the very topmost layer on this is minimal. Instead you may choose an orientation that looks better for your part. For instance, you could align the lines lengthwise with your model to create a nicer visual flow.
