For printers that have multiple extruders, this selects the extruder that will be used to print the top surface.

This way you can give the top surface a different colour or material. Keep in mind that the extruder of the walls is not adjusted by this setting, so there will still be a rim around the top surface.

Other than giving the top surface a different colour, you could also use this to print the top surface with a different material. This can give a variety of effects:
* Print the top surface and outer wall in PLA while printing the rest with a more rigid material to get a strong object that also looks good.
* Print the top surface with TPU but the rest with a harder material to achieve a soft, high-friction gripping surface.
* Print the top surface with a material that is more slippery than the stronger material you need for the insides of the model, if something needs to slide over the surface.

**If the material for the top surface doesn't stick well to the material below it, it tends to let go after printing. Be especially careful with materials with high shrinkage ratios.**
