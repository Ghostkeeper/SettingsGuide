Outer Nozzle Diameter
====
This setting describes the outside diameter of the nozzle tip at its thinnest point, in the bottom.

Other settings can use this to automatically set some defaults, such as the spacing between ironing lines.

*Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.*
