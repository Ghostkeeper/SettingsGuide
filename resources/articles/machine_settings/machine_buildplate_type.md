Build Plate Material
====
With this setting, you can indicate what type of material your build plate is made out of. There are currently two options: aluminium or glass.

Cura does absolutely nothing with this information, except to pass it on to the g-code in the Griffin g-code header. This way, the printer can know whether the g-code was intended for the correct build plate.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
