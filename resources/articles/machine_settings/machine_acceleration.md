Default Acceleration
====
This setting indicates the acceleration that your firmware uses if Cura is not [controlling the acceleration](../speed/acceleration_enabled.md) of the print.

This is used to obtain correct time estimates for your print if Cura is not controlling the acceleration rates. The entire print will use the same acceleration rate then.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
