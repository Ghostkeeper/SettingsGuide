Nozzle Angle
====
This setting contains a measurement of the angle of the nozzle tip, in degrees. A lower angle means that the tip is very sharp. A higher angle means that the tip is stubby.

This angle is used to determine the clearance between adjacent struts when using [wire printing](../experimental/wireframe_enabled.md). If the nozzle is very stubby, the vertical struts must be spaced very far apart in order to prevent the nozzle hitting other struts.

*Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.*
