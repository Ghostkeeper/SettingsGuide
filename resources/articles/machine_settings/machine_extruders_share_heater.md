Extruders Share Heater
====
With this setting, you can indicate that all of the nozzles in this printer share a single heater. It will not heat up and cool down your nozzles individually then as some nozzles activate and become inactive again, but just keeps it warm.

Most commonly this is necessary for mixing nozzles, where multiple filaments are fed into the same nozzle. This nozzle just has one heater that heats up whichever filament is inside the nozzle at the time. If Cura would control the heating for each filament separately, it would simultaneously try to keep the nozzle hot for the active filament, while cooling it down to the [stand-by temperature](../material/material_standby_temperature.md) for the other filaments. This is impossible, and results in either heating up only for the first filament, or permanently printing on stand-by temperature if the firmware just applies the heating commands to the one nozzle regardless of which tool they are aimed at. Indicating to Cura that the extruders share a heater prevents this problem. Cura will no longer let the nozzle go to the stand-by temperature and doesn't apply a heating command to any specific extruder any more.

Cura will not necessarily assume that if the extruders share a heater they also share a nozzle. If they do, the relative nozzle positions need to be 0 and most likely there needs to be some extruder start sequence to purge the previous material when switching.
