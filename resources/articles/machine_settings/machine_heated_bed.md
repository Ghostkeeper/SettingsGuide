Has Heated Build Plate
====
This setting indicates whether or not the printer has a build plate that can control the temperature. These types of build plates are installed in many 3D printers to improve adhesion between the print and the build plate.

If the printer has no heated build plate, the [Build Plate Temperature](../material/material_bed_temperature.md) setting and its related settings will not be shown to the user. Cura will also not issue any build plate temperature commands to the printer.

**Since this is a machine setting, it will not normally be listed in the normal list of settings. There is a checkbox for this setting though in the printer settings dialogue, which can be found in the list of added printers in the preferences dialogue.**
