Number of Extruders
====
This setting configures how many extruders this printer has. Some printers have multiple extruders so that they can change the material they are printing with during the same print.

For each of the extruders, Cura will show a tab with settings. The settings can be adjusted separately for the most part, though some settings can't be adjusted per extruder (such as build volume temperature). The number of extruders is also limited by the extruder definition files available to the current printer, since Cura also needs more information about these extruders such as their relative position on the print head.

**Since this is a machine setting, it will not normally be listed in the normal list of settings. There is a drop-down widget in the printer settings dialogue, which can be found in the list of added printers in the preferences dialogue.**
