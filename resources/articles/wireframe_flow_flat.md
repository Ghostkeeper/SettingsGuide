This setting configures the flow rate (and thereby the thickness of the wires) of the horizontal rings in the wire frame structure. This can be configured separately from the speed of the upwards and downwards connecting wires.

Increasing the flow makes the wires thicker. This makes the horizontal rings more rigid once they have solidified. However it also increases the heat mass of the horizontal rings, making them take longer to solidify. This makes the wires droop and reduces the reliability of the print, since the wires may not connect properly any more then.
