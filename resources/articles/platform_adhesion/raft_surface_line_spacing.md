This setting indicates the spacing between the lines of the top layers of the raft. This is in a way similar to the [Infill Line Distance](../infill/infill_line_distance.md) setting.

![Dimensions related to the raft](../images/raft_dimensions.svg)

Typically the top layers of the raft are very dense, meaning that the lines are spaced fairly close together. A denser top layer makes the surface of the raft smoother. This causes the bottom side of the print on top of the raft to be smoother as well. A smoother top surface improves adhesion between the model and the raft as well.
