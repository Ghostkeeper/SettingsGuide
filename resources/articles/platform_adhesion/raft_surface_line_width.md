Raft Top Line Width
====
This setting indicates how wide the lines of the top layers of the raft will be.

![Dimensions related to the raft](../images/raft_dimensions.svg)

In order to produce a smooth surface for the raft, the lines of the top layers should be quite thin and spaced closed together with the [Raft Top Spacing](raft_surface_line_spacing.md) setting. Thinner lines produce a smoother surface which will in turn produce a smoother bottom side of the print and improve adhesion between the raft and the print.

However, thinner and closely spaced lines also take considerably longer to print. Making the lines too thin causes underextrusion as well, which makes the adhesion between the raft and the model weaker.
