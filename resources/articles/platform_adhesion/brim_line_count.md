Brim Line Count
====
Controls how many perimeters are being drawn around the base of your print.

![This brim has 8 lines.](../images/brim_width.svg)

More brim lines will improve adhesion to the build plate, by increasing the surface area of your print. However, it will reduce the effective print area.

**This setting overrides the [Brim Width](brim_width.md) setting.**
