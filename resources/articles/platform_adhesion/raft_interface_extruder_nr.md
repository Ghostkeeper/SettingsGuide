Raft Middle Extruder
====
This setting selects the extruder to use for the middle layers of the raft.

The interface layers are nested in between the base layer and the top layers. They function as a buffer zone to keep the heat of the build plate away from the top layers, to provide some structural strength and to support the top layers better than what the base layer could. It is therefore important to choose a material that sticks well to the materials in the base and top layers.
