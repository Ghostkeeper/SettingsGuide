Raft Base Line Spacing
====
This setting adjusts how far the lines in the base layer of the raft are spaced apart. This is in a way similar to the [Infill Line Distance](../infill/infill_line_distance.md) setting. The main purpose is to adjust how well the raft adheres to the build plate.

![Dimensions related to the raft](../images/raft_dimensions.svg)

Reducing the spacing between the lines of the base layers will have a few effects:
* A smaller spacing will improve adhesion of the raft to the build plate, because there will be more surface with which the raft can stick.
* The raft will be slightly stiffer.
* It will take longer to print the initial layer of the raft. This layer is printed very slowly, so the effect is larger than with the other raft layers.
