Skirt Distance
====
This setting adjusts the distance between the model and the skirt.

By keeping enough distance, the skirt won't attach to the model, reducing the elephant's feet effect.

This is the distance of the closest line of the skirt. If the skirt consists of multiple lines, those will be placed further.
