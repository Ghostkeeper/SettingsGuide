This setting configures the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while the middle layer of the raft is printed. The jerk rate during the middle layer of the raft can be configured separately from the base and top layers.

Since the raft generally consists of long line segments, increasing the jerk rate normally has very little impact on printing time. Increasing the jerk rate will save a bit of time when going through corners at the end of the lines though.

Increasing the jerk rate will cause the printer to vibrate more while printing the middle layer of the raft. This slightly increases the risk of pulling the raft off of the build plate.
