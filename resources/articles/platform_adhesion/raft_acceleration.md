Raft Print Acceleration
====
This setting configures the acceleration rate of the print head while the raft is being printed.

Since the raft generally consists of long line segments, increasing acceleration normally has very little impact on printing time. Increasing the acceleration will save a bit of time when going through corners at the end of the lines though.

Increasing the acceleration rate will cause the printer to vibrate more while printing the raft. For the top surface, this will make the raft's surface rougher. For other layers, it affects the adhesion to the build plate more.
