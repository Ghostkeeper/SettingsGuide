Raft Middle Spacing
====
This setting adjusts the spacing between adjacent lines in the middle layer of the raft. This is in a way similar to the [Infill Line Distance](../infill/infill_line_distance.md) setting. The main purpose is to adjust the stiffness of the raft and how well the top layer gets supported.

Having the lines spaced far apart reduces the printing time of the raft. It also makes the raft easier to bend, which allows it to break off more easily. However, if the lines are spaced very far apart the top layers of the raft won't get supported well. This makes the raft's surface uneven, which reduces the adhesion between the raft and model but also makes the model's bottom side messier.
