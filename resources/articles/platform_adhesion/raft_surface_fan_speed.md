Raft Top Fan Speed
====
This setting configures the fan speed while printing the top layers of the raft. The fan speed while printing the top layers can be configured separately from the base and middle layers.

Configuring the fan speed for the top layers separately is useful since the fan speed greatly affects the bed adhesion, but this is not an issue for the top layers. Increasing the fan speed will improve the smoothness of the top surface of the raft though (which is not an issue for the lower layers). It is therefor useful to set the fan speed of the top surfaces somewhat higher than the fan speed of the lower layers. However setting the fan speed too high can cause warping with some materials.
