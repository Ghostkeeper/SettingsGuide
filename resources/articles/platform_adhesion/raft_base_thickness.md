This setting adjusts the vertical thickness of the lowest layer of the raft.

![Dimensions related to the raft](../images/raft_dimensions.svg)

Similar to the [Initial Layer Height](../resolution/layer_height_0.md) setting, increasing the height of the initial layer of the raft causes the nozzle to extrude with more force. This improves adhesion between the raft and the build plate. Additionally, the extra thickness can catch any variability in the height of the build plate, if your build plate is not exactly level.
