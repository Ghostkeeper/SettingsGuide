This setting configures the speed at which the cooling fans will spin while the raft is being printed.

Increasing the fan speed causes the material to cool down more quickly. This can cause warping as internal stresses in the plastic are not able to relax before the plastic sets. It can also cause the raft to adhere less well to the build plate, since the material is not able to flow out as much as it would otherwise, to increase its contact area with the build plate. However with increased fan speed the lines will also bridge better in the middle and top layers, producing a smoother surface for your raft which ultimately leads to a smoother surface for your print.

When the raft is used, the [fan speed at the initial layer](cool_fan_speed_0.md) will affect the fan speed at the initial layer of the model, rather than the first layer of the raft.
