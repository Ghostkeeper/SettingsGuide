Raft Middle Print Jerk
====
This setting configures the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the raft.

Since the raft generally consists of long line segments, increasing the jerk rate normally has very little impact on printing time. Increasing the jerk rate will save a bit of time when going through corners at the end of the lines though.

Increasing the jerk rate will cause the printer to vibrate more while printing the raft. For the top surface, this will make the raft's surface rougher. For other layers, it affects the adhesion to the build plate more.
