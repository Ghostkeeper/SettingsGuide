The speed at which the fans on the print head will spin throughout most of the print. This is a percentage of the maximum capabilities of the fans.
![Which fan speed is used where](cool_fan_speed.svg)
* A greater speed allows better cooling. This reduces oozing and stringing.
* A lower speed will reduce warping with some materials and will make the print stronger.
* The fan speed should almost always be maximum when printing materials with a low glass transition temperature range, such as PLA.
