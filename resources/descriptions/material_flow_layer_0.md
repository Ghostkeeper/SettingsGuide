Just like the ordinary [Flow](material_flow) setting, this setting adjusts the amount of material being pushed through the nozzle, but this one only affects the layer that rests on the build plate.

Adjusting the flow directly adjusts how much material is placed down. Normally the amount of material is calculated by Cura such that the material would fill the exact space in the line's width, height and length, but this can be adjusted using the flow settings.

Increasing the flow for the first layer causes the material to be pushed harder onto the build plate. This improves adhesion to the build plate. This setting can also be used to adjust for an improperly levelled bed. If the bed is too close, you'll want to reduce the flow. If the bed is too far, you'll want to increase the flow. It's still better to properly adjust the bed though, if you have that capability.
