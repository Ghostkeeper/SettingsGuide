This setting determines how much spacing the ooze shield must keep (at minimum) from your object. Some small distance must be kept to prevent the ooze shield or the blobs on it from sticking to your model.

Put the ooze shield as close to the model as possible without hitting the model. The closer the shield is to your model, the less time there is between the shield and the model for the nozzle to ooze further.

Sometimes the shield will have a greater distance to the model, because the shield must also maintain a certain overhang angle in order to not collapse.
