This setting adjusts the jerk only during the parts where the printer is ironing.

Similar to the Top/Bottom Jerk setting, you can reduce the jerk for ironing in order to achieve a better top surface quality. If the jerk is too high, vibrations in the printer's frame may cause the build plate to move up and down (depending on the printer's design) which causes ringing.
