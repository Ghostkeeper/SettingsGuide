This setting is only available when printing with a raft. It lowers all layers of the model, except the initial layer. This compresses the first layer harder onto the raft.
![Dimensions that make up a raft](raft_dimensions.svg)
The intent of this setting is to make up for the air gap in the raft. However the initial layer will have had some time to cool down further away from the raft, preventing it from sticking too much to the raft. Afterwards, the first layer will get pressed down onto the raft by the second layer, so that the print will still be stable.
* Increasing the overlap may give you stronger adhesion to the raft, which increases reliability.
* This setting affects your dimensional accuracy in the vertical direction.
* This setting may cause overextrusion if it is set very high.
