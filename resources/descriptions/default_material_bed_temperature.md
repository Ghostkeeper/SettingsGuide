This setting defines the build plate temperature during the printing process that is ideal for the material. Changing the build plate temperature in the material manager is actually this setting being change. The actual build plate temperature may still vary for different quality profiles. It is uncommon to need to change this setting unless you are using an uncommon material.

The setting is used for the ordinary Build Plate Temperature setting and the Build Plate Temperature Initial Layer.

When printing with multiple different material, the temperature of the build plate will be set to the highest of these materials.
