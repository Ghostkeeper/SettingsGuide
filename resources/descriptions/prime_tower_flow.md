The flow rate of the prime tower. If this is increased, more material is pushed in a smaller amount of space.

Increasing this setting causes the nozzle to prime faster. This can save some time. Increasing it too much though can cause overextrusion. As a result there could be blobs on the prime tower which can cause the tower to be knocked over.

This setting is taken into account when calculating how many perimeters the prime tower will have to prime enough volume for the [Prime Tower Minimum Volume](prime_tower_min_volume) setting, so increasing the flow will cause the prime tower to have fewer perimeters.
