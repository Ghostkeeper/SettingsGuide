		"hints" : "- For example, if a minimum layer time of 5 seconds requires the printer to print at a speed of 8 mm/s, it will only do that if at least 8 mm/s is set as minimum speed. If the minimum speed is set at 10 mm/s, that means that it won’t print slower than 10 mm/s and that the layer time will change accordingly, and would then be shorter than 5 seconds."
