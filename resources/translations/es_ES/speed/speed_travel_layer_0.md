Initial Layer Travel Speed
====
This setting adjusts the speed of the travel moves during the printing of the first layer.

The print speed needs to be lower during the first layer than during the rest of the print, because there is a greater chance for the nozzle to rip the print off the build plate.

During the first layer, the print is more sensitive to vibrations of the build plate. Increasing the initial layer's travel speed can cause more vibrations. This results in reduced adhesion between the print and the build plate, increasing chance of failure in the end.

Still, the travel speed during the first layer can be higher than the printing speed, since it does not get underextrusion.
