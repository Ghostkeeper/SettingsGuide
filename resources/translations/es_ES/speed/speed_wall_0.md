Outer Wall Speed
====
The speed at which the outer walls are printed can be configured separately from the normal print speed or from the inner walls.

The outer walls are the most major factor in the visual quality of a print, so they should look nice. The printing speed of the outer walls is a major factor in how nice these walls look. It is therefore advisable to make the outer walls print very slowly. This reduces vibrations in the printer, which ultimately reduces ringing. It also improves the quality of overhang, because the slower printing speed allows the fans to cool down the walls better, giving it more strength to hang in the air.

If the outer wall printing speed is too low however, there is a risk of introducing too great of a flow change. If the nozzle suddenly has to extrude much more slowly, it will still extrude a lot of material for a while while the pressure in the nozzle chamber drops, so at the beginning of the wall it will overextrude.

The outer walls are also a significant part of the printing time, so reducing the speed at which these walls are printed will drastically increase the printing time.
