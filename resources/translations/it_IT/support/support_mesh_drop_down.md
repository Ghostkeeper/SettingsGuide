Drop Down Support Mesh
====
If this setting is enabled for an object, and that object is a support mesh, then the support mesh will get supported with support as well. Instead of just printing the mesh's volume as support, the support mesh will get support printed beneath it as well.

If the support mesh is printed just as normal support, you have full control over how the support gets shaped. This is ideal for support that gets modelled separately in CAD software or by specialised applications like [MeshMixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/). However when using more low-tech solutions like simple cubes as support meshes, it may be easier to just cause them to be dropped down to the build plate so that the support is stable.

**This setting is only available in the per-object settings.** It does not appear in the normal settings list.
