Support Roof Pattern
====
The pattern with which the roof of the support is drawn can be configured separately from the rest of the support.

The support roof is often much denser than the rest of the support. Some patterns don't work all that well at high densities, so it can then be useful to choose a pattern that works better at high densities, such as concentric or zigzag rather than grid or triangles.

The support roof is also the part that actually supports the overhang area. You can therefor choose a pattern that optimises the overhang quality, rather than optimising for other properties of support such as solubility or stability.
