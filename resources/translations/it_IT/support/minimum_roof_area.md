Minimum Support Roof Area
====
This setting causes pieces of the support roof to be left out if they are very small. Instead of the support roof, normal support will be printed.

Some materials only extrude well at high flow rates and need some time to get going. If such materials are used for the support roof, they won't be much use for small roof areas. Leaving them out can save a lot of time switching extruders and travelling around and prevents blobs on the surface. Instead Cura will draw normal support, so that the model can be supported better as well.
