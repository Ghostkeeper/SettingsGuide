Support Interface Thickness
====
This setting defines how thick the interface layer is between the support and the model.

A thicker interface reduces the savings that would be made by using a support interface rather than printing all of the support at increased density.

However it increases the effectiveness of the interface as well. As the sparser support infill gets bridged by the lines of the interface, the interface lines sag a bit. By building multiple interface layers, this sagging can be reduced, which makes the surface of the support interface more even. This in turn makes the overhanging surface more even.
