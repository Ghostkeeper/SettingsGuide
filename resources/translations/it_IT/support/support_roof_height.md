Support Roof Thickness
====
This setting defines how thick the support roof is, where the model rests on the support.

A thicker roof reduces the savings that would be made by using a support roof rather than printing all of the support at increased density.

However it increases the effectiveness of the roof as well. As the sparser support infill gets bridged by the lines of the roof, the roof lines sag a bit. By building multiple roof layers, this sagging can be reduced, which makes the surface of the support roof more even. This in turn makes the overhanging surface more even.
