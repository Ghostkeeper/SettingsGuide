Enable Support Roof
====
The support roof is an intermediary structure between the support and the model where the model rests on the support. It can be used to provide more or better support for the model without significantly impacting printing time. The support roof is typically printed more densely or slower.

By default the support roof is denser than the normal support. This provides a better quality overhang, since the model doesn't need to bridge large distances. However, it will be much harder to remove the support.

The support roof can also be printed with a different extruder than the rest of the support. Some materials aimed at printing support can be very expensive and slow to print. This way, most of the support is still printed with the cheaper or faster material, but the roof where the use of the support material comes to fruition is printed with the fancier material.
