Support Interface Pattern
====
The pattern with which the support interface is drawn can be configured separately from the rest of the support.

The support interface is often much denser than the rest of the support. Some patterns don't work all that well at high densities, so it can then be useful to choose a pattern that works better at high densities, such as concentric or zigzag rather than grid or triangles.

Since the support interface is the part of support that does the brunt of the work of supporting, it may be useful to choose a pattern that optimises for overhang quality, rather than optimising for other properties of support such as solubility or stability.
