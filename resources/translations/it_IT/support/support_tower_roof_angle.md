Tower Roof Angle
====
Support towers get a pointy top, which transitions the wider pillar of the tower towards the narrow area of overhang that actually needs to get supported.

A higher value makes the support towers have a very pointy roof. This causes the tower to start reducing its width a bit lower down already, which reduces the stability of the tower but saves on some material and printing time.

A lower value makes the support towers have a flatter roof.
