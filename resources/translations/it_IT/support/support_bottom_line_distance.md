Support Floor Line Distance
====
This setting configures the distance between any two adjacent lines in the support floor pattern, where the support rests on the model.

Reducing the distance between lines in the support floor will increase the contact area between the support and the model, causing it to stick better. This can make the support more stable, but also harder to remove. Materials that are specialised for easy removal can benefit greatly from this, such as materials with different shrinkage ratios or soluble materials.
