Support Horizontal Expansion
====
This setting causes the support to become slightly wider, expanding horizontally in every direction.

This setting has multiple uses, depending on the material used for support and the type of model that needs supporting:
* Increasing this setting will make support wider and thus sturdier. This is useful for tall models with small areas of overhang, since the overhang would otherwise be supported with a very tall, thin pillar of support. With some horizontal expansion, it becomes a very tall but slightly wider pillar of support.
* Increasing this setting also functions as a safety measure to make sure that support areas have a certain minimum area. This is necessary for materials that are hard to extrude, such as PVA.
* Reducing this setting will reduce material usage and printing time for support. Increasing it will increase the required material and printing time, of course. See also the [conical support](../experimental/support_conical_enabled.md) feature, which reduces the width of support without compromising the area that the support supports.
* Setting this setting to a negative value can also remove thin pillars of support completely. If that support would fail to print anyway, it may be better to just leave it out altogether. A method to remove support without compromising the overhang quality of the rest of the model is the Support Blocker tool.
