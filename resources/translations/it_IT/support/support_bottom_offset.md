Support Floor Horizontal Expansion
====
This setting causes the support floor to expand in all horizontal directions into the rest of the support.

Some materials typically used to print support with extrude badly at low flow rates or need some time to get going. Small areas of support floor don't jive well with those materials. This setting can literally make the areas larger so that there is more space to extrude these materials.
