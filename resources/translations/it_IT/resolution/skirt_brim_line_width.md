Skirt/Brim Line Width
====
This setting configures the width of a single skirt or brim line (whichever is active).

When using a brim, a slightly increased line width will improve the adhesion between the brim and the build plate. This is because the nozzle will extrude the material with more force, so that the brim gets pushed harder on to the build plate. The brim does not need to look pretty, so it's useful to have the brim line width as high as can feasibly be printed.

For the skirt, increasing the line width causes it to use more material. However it will allow for good priming in a shorter amount of time, so fewer skirt lines are necessary for small objects.

**The line width of the skirt and brim is also influenced by the [Initial Layer Line Width](initial_layer_line_width_factor.md) setting.**
