Initial Bottom Layers
====
This setting determines the number of layers on the bottom side of the print where the print rests on the build plate.

The function of the bottom side of the print is threefold: To make the print watertight, to hide the infill from sight, and to provide strength. Skin that is resting on the build plate is laying there very stable, so it is very easy to make it watertight and hide the infill. Usually, the skin is already watertight after one layer, and the infill will be hidden depending on the translucency of the material, but often after a layer or two. If strength is not an issue, it's useful to reduce the number of bottom layers where the print rests on the build plate. This saves a lot of time. The extra thickness of the bottom side is only necessary where there is overhang or when printing on top of support.

Reducing the number of bottom layers where the print rests on the build plate saves a lot of printing time and material, especially for large flat prints. However, the strength of the print will be compromised severely.
