Ironing Line Spacing
====
This setting changes the space between every line of ironing. Ironing lines are normally much closer together than the actual printing lines, which is a major contributor to its effectiveness.

* Increasing the line spacing will reduce printing time.
* However, reducing the line spacing will improve the top surface quality.
