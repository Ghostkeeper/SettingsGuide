Inner Wall(s) Flow
====
This setting adjusts the flow rate for the inner walls only. The flow rate for the inner walls can be adjusted separately from the flow rate of the outer wall.

Adjusting the flow rate during the inner walls is a stop gap method to fix problems with extrusion rate or dimensional accuracy.

If there is a problem with extrusion rate only during the inner walls, it is better to look at the [printing speeds](../speed/speed_wall_x.md) and [printing temperature](material_print_temperature.md). Perhaps the material doesn't get enough momentum out the nozzle and a greater print speed could help. Perhaps the [lines are too thin](../resolution/wall_line_width_x.md) to extrude properly. Perhaps the material is too cool or too hot.

If there is a problem with dimensional accuracy, it is better to look at [line widths](../resolution/wall_line_width_x.md), [horizontal expansion](../shell/xy_offset.md) and the [printing order](../shell/outer_inset_first.md).
