Build Volume Temperature
====
Some printers have an enclosed box to print in that has a heating element and temperature sensors inside, so that they can control how warm it gets inside the box. For those printers, this setting controls how warm the air in the box becomes.

Printing at a greater build volume temperature can reduce the warping effect from the print cooling down after printing, since it cools down less. It also anneals the plastic, which also contributs to reducing warping and increases strength, especially if the material is crystalline. For some high-temperature materials such as polyoxymethylene (POM) a warm build volume is pretty much required for successful printing.

However printing at a greater temperature will also reduce the effectiveness of cooling with the fans. This reduces overhang quality and causes sagging and elephant feet.
