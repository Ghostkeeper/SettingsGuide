Printing Temperature Initial Layer
====
The nozzle can print at a slightly different temperature during the first layer than for the rest of the print.

This is useful to improve bed adhesion. At a slightly higher temperature the material will be more liquid during the first layer. This allows it to flow out further, reducing the air bubbles below the print and increasing the contact area with the build plate. It also allows the material to anneal a bit longer which reduces warping. You wouldn't want the higher temperature for the rest of the print because it would cause overhangs to sag and cause stringing.
