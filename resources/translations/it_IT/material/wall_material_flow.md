Wall Flow
====
This setting adjusts the flow rate for the walls only. The flow rate for the walls can be adjusted separately from the flow rate of the rest of the print.

Adjusting the flow rate during the walls is a stop gap method to fix problems with extrusion rate or dimensional accuracy.

If there is a problem with extrusion rate only during the walls, it is better to look at the [printing speeds](../speed/speed_wall.md) and [temperature](material_print_temperature.md). Perhaps the material doesn't get enough momentum out the nozzle and a greater print speed could help. Perhaps the [lines are too thin](../resolution/wall_line_width.md) to extrude properly. Perhaps the material is too cool or too hot.

If there is a problem with dimensional accuracy, it is better to look at [line widths](../resolution/wall_line_width.md), [horizontal expansion](../shell/xy_offset.md) and the [printing order](../shell/outer_inset_first.md).
