Mold Roof Height
====
This setting specifies how thick the top and bottom sides of your mould will become. This is only the vertical thickness. The horizontal thickness is determined by the [Minimal Mold Width](mold_width.md) setting.

There will not be a horizontal part at the highest point of your model, so that you can pour the material in. There will also not be a horizontal part beneath the model, because the build plate itself serves to close the mould there. If a horizontal part beneath the model is desired, the raft can be used to that end.

Printing thicker top and bottom sides will make your mould stronger and more resistant to shrinkage. However, it also takes more material and takes longer to print.
