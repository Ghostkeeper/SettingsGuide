Travel Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while travelling across the build volume. The acceleration during travelling can be set to a different rate than while material is extruded.

Travel moves are often extremely fast and can be quite long, straight lines. This allows the nozzle to reach great speeds and this makes acceleration a big factor in the printing time. Since the printer is not extruding any material during these moves, any vibrations of the printer don't have any real effect on the print. As a result, the travel acceleration should be set pretty high to save on printing time.

Setting the acceleration too high can cause the motors to lose some steps, which can cause layer shifts to appear.
