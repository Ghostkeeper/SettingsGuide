Initial Layer Travel Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while the travelling across the build plate during the initial layer. This can be configured separately from the extrusion moves during the initial layer.

During the travel moves, the adhesion between the print and the build plate is not affected by vibrations. If the build plate vibrates too much, the nozzle can still rip the print off the build plate though. For this reason, the jerk during the travel moves of the initial layer can be set somewhat higher than the jerk during the extrusion moves, but still lower than the jerk during travel moves on different layers.
