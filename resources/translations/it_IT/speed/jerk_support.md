Support Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the support. This can be configured separately from the rest of the print.

For the support, carefully going through corners is not important. The support doesn't need to be pretty. It simply needs to stay standing. The jerk can be set pretty high during the printing of support. Generally this makes supports stronger as well as easier to remove, since the extrusion rate will be more constant.

Increasing the jerk too much increases the chance of a layer shift though. It really tests the limits of the motors.
