Prime Tower Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the prime tower. The acceleration during the prime tower can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.

Printing the prime tower at a greater acceleration rate allows the extrusion to be somewhat more constant, allowing for better priming. It also saves on printing time. However the prime tower may topple more easily if it gets very high and the printer vibrates a lot during its printing.

<!--if cura_version <= 4.1:The prime tower acceleration has a significant effect if the [square prime tower](../dual/prime_tower_circular.md) is used, because there are actually corners to take. With a round prime tower, the effect of this acceleration setting is negligible since all of the acceleration will be caught by the jerk setting.-->
