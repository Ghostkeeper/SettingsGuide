Support Speed
====
This setting configures the speed at which the support structures are printed.

Normally the support doesn't need to be printed very accurately, so it is safe to print the support at a higher speed than the rest of the print. This can save some printing time.

Increasing the speed too much causes a difference in flow rate between the support and the rest of the print though, which causes overextrusion when switching from support to the print and underextrusion when switching from the print to support.
