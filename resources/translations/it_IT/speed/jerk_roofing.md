Top Surface Skin Jerk
====
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the top surfaces. This can be configured separately from the rest of the top side.

Increasing the jerk for this part of the print will prevent the nozzle from coming to a standstill in the corners between adjacent top surface lines. This will allow the line width to be more consistent overall. This has a greater effect if the line width is much smaller than the nozzle size, which is a common use case for the top surface. Increasing the jerk too much though can cause the build plate to vibrate, creating an uneven surface. It could even cause the motors to lose steps, which would cause a layer shift.
