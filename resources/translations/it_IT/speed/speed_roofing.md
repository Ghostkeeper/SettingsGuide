Top Surface Skin Speed
====
This setting adjusts the speed at which the top surface layers are printed, if there are any top surface skin layers as configured with the [Top Surface Skin Layers](../top_bottom/roofing_layer_count.md) setting.

The top surface is very visible, so it could be worth the extra time to print this at a lower speed than the rest of the skin. That would improve the visual quality and water tightness of the top surface. Reducing this speed too much though will introduce a great flow change when switching to and from the top surface.
