Infill Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the infill. The acceleration during infill can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.

Since the infill is on the inside where it is not visible, adjusting the acceleration of infill tends to have a low impact on the visual quality of the print. Infill lines tend to have long straight lines printed at high speed and joined by sharp corners. Acceleration has a big impact on printing time for those lines. Because of this, it is common to set the acceleration rate for infill somewhat higher than the acceleration for the rest of the print.
