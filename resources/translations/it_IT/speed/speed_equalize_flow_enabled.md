Equalize Filament Flow
====
Adjusting the flow rate through the nozzle takes a while. Adjusting the speed of the print head is faster. With this setting, the movement speed will be adjusted rather than the extrusion rate when printing the gap filling technique.

The movement speed is adjusted such that the flow rate can remain equal. However, the gap filling technique often has many travel moves that also interrupt the flow, so it typically hardly makes a difference.

The disadvantage of enabling this feature is that you sometimes get very fast extrusion moves. This can cause some vibration. But again, the gap filling technique often already produces many vibrations, so it will not make much of a difference on that part either.
