Support Floor Acceleration
====
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the support floor. The acceleration during the support bottom can be set to a different rate than the support roof.

While the accuracy for support interface is important for good overhang quality as well as how well the support sticks to the model and how much scarring it leaves, the overhang quality is not an issue for the support floor. It may be advantageous to leave the support floor acceleration slightly higher than that of the support roof, to save a bit on printing time. Increasing acceleration too much though can introduce additional scarring and may compromise the stability of the support that rests on it.
