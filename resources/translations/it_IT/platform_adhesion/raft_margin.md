Raft Extra Margin
====
This setting makes the raft wider than the model. It indicates the width of the extra border around the model.

![Dimensions related to the raft](../images/raft_dimensions.svg)

Increasing this setting will greatly improve adhesion between the raft and the build plate. Not only is there a greater area for the raft to stick to the build plate, but the expansions also softens the corners of the raft. With softer corners, warping will have less of an effect on the raft. Secondly, a larger raft allows you to break away the raft from the model more easily, since there is some area to grab the raft with.

However, increasing the Raft Extra Margin will also take more space on the build plate. It will take more material and time to print the raft.
