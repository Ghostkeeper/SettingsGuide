Raft Base Line Width
====
This setting configures the width of the lines with which the lowest layer of the raft is being drawn.

![Dimensions related to the raft](../images/raft_dimensions.svg)

The lines of the base layer of the raft should be very thick. Thicker lines will cause the material to be pushed very hard on the build plate, which improves adhesion. The lines can be a bit wider than the nozzle size, but there is a limit to how far the material can flow sideways with small nozzles.
