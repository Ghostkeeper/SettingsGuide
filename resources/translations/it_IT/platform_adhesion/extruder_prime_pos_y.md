Extruder Prime Y Position
====
Some printers can prime the extrusion process before printing using a special g-code command (G280). This setting, combined with the [Extruder Prime X Position](extruder_prime_pos_x.md) setting, will define where this priming is being done. This setting defines the Y coordinate.

These coordinates are in the g-code coordinate system, which is different from the coordinate system that Cura uses to show the placement of objects.

Cura will indicate the location where the priming will happen with a small circle on the build plate. You are not allowed to print any objects there.
