Raft Air Gap
====
To allow the raft to be broken off from the actual print, a gap is kept between the model and the raft. This makes the printer put the object down lightly on top of the raft.

Increasing the gap allows you to remove the raft more easily, but will increase the likelyhood for the raft to let go during printing as well, which ruins your print. If you're printing the raft with a different model than the model on top of the raft, it's advisable to keep this distance fairly low, or the print has a high chance of failure.
