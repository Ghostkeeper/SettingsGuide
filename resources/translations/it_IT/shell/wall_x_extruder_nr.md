Inner Wall Extruder
====
If your printer has multiple extruders, you can choose to print just the inner walls with a different extruder.

It's wise to print the inner walls with the same extruder as either the infill, the skin or the outer walls. There is no real use case for printing the inner walls with a different extruder than the rest, except perhaps for an interesting visual effect. The colour of the inner wall tends to shine through the outer wall slightly.

Printing the inner walls with the same extruder as the infill, skin or the outer wall allows it to bind better to those structures. This creates a stronger part. When adjusting the extruder of those other structures, keep in mind what you'd like to bind the inner walls to.
