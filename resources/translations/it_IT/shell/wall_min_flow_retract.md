Prefer Retract
====
Compensating for overlaps in wall lines will reduce the flow rate of some of the walls. If this flow rate gets below the value of the [Minimum Wall Flow](wall_min_flow.md) setting, a travel move is made instead of the wall line.

If this setting is enabled, the filament will be retracted during that travel move.

The intended effect of this setting is to reduce oozing on the walls. The intent of the Minimum Wall Flow setting is to reduce the ooze from extremely thin walls which doesn't look nice. That can be improved even further by enabling this setting.

However retracting on the outer walls causes the nozzle to pause momentarily while the filament is retracted. This leaves a blob on the surface where the retraction was made. It also increases printing time and wears down the filament faster.
