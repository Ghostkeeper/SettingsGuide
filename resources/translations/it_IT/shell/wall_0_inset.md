Outer Wall Inset
====
This setting causes the outer wall to be moved slightly more towards the inside.

The aim of this setting is to improve dimensional accuracy when using a line width smaller than the nozzle size. When the outer wall is printed with a smaller line than the nozzle size, the material can flow outward more than the desired line width, making the print wider than desired. Moving the outer wall slightly inside causes the nozzle to overlap with the inner walls, forcing the material in the location adjacent to the inner wall. This only works when printing the outer wall after the inner walls.

Printing the outer wall more towards the inside can also increase the adhesion between the outer wall and the inner walls. This adhesion is very important to the strength of the part.
