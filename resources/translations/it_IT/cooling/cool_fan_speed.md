Fan Speed
====
The speed at which the fans on the print head will spin throughout most of the print. This is a percentage of the maximum capabilities of the fans.

![Which fan speed is used where](../images/cool_fan_speed.svg)

* A greater speed allows better cooling. This reduces oozing and stringing.
* A greater speed will produce better overhangs and reduces the pillowing effect.
* A lower speed will reduce warping with some materials and will make the print stronger.

The fan speed should almost always be maximum when printing materials with a low glass transition temperature range, such as PLA. These materials have virtually no downsides to cooling quickly, since the heat of the nozzle easily keeps the temperature above the glass transition range.
