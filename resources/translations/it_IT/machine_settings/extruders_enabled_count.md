Number of Extruders That Are Enabled
====
This setting stores how many extruders are currently enabled in the front-end. Extruders can be enabled or disabled with a checkbox in the configuration menu in the top-centre of the screen.

This setting is automatically adjusted by Cura whenever the user enables or disables an extruder. The setting should not be changed by the user or in profiles. Other settings can use this to determine an appropriate setting value or to see whether multi-extrusion settings should get shown or not.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
