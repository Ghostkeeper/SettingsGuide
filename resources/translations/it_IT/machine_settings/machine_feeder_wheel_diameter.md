Feeder Wheel Diameter
====
This setting is a measurement of the diameter of the wheel that moves the filament back and forth inside the feeder.

![The feeder wheel is usually the one with the most grippy surface](../images/machine_feeder_wheel_diameter.svg)

This setting is not used by Cura at all. However it is used by the X3GWriter plug-in in order to control the feeder correctly. It needs to know how fast to move the feeder in order to move the filament the correct distance.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
