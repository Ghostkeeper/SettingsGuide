Filament Park Distance
====
This setting used to indicate where to park the filament after it is no longer used. If you're printing with multiple extruders and one of the extruders doesn't need to print as high as the other, it would put the filament in a parking position just after its last usage. However this is no longer done. Instead, it'll now retract to the [Nozzle Switch Retraction Distance](../dual/switch_extruder_retraction_amount.md).

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
