Maximum Speed X
====
This setting indicates the highest speed that your printer can reach in the X direction.

This is used to limit the [print speed](../speed/speed_print.md) and related settings. You can't use a printing speed that is higher than the maximum speed when moving diagonally with all axes at the same time. It is also used to compute correct time estimates if a move is not moving diagonally and then exceeds the maximum speed in the X axis.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
