Y Endstop in Positive Direction
====
This setting tells Cura in which direction the printer will move along the Y axis when it is ordered to home. If this setting is disabled, it assumes that the endstop for the Y axis is at the zero (or negative) coordinate of the build volume. If the setting is enabled, it assumes that the endstop for the Y axis is at the printer's maximum Y coordinate. When the printer homes, it will need to move towards those endstops to allow the printer to know where the print head is.

This setting is not used by Cura at all. However it is used by the X3GWriter plug-in to implement the homing g-code command correctly when writing an X3G tool path file.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
