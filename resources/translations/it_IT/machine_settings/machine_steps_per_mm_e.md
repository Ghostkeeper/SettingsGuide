Steps per Millimeter (E)
====
Most 3D printers use stepper motors in their feeders to move the filament back and forth. These motors rotate in steps, and have difficulty staying between two positions of the steps. The steps are essentially the precision of the feeder. This setting indicates that precision: How many steps of the motor would result in moving the filament by one millimetre?

This does not apply for printers that don't use stepper motors in their feeders. Cura will also assume that the step sizes of the feeders are the same for every extruder, if there are multiple feeders involved.

This setting is not used in Cura at all. However it is used by the X3Gwriter plug-in to output X3G files with correct step sizes.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
