Machine Height
====
This setting indicates the vertical range of Z coordinates through which the nozzle(s) are able to move. It's basically the usable size of the printer.

This is not equal to the actual height of your printer on the shelf. The actual printer will also have a gantry or an arm and a base around its build volume, and this measurement doesn't include that size. It's only the size of the build volume, the coordinates where the nozzle could move.

**Since this is a machine setting, it will not normally be listed in the normal list of settings. The height can be changed in the printer settings dialogue, which can be found in the list of added printers in the preferences dialogue.**
