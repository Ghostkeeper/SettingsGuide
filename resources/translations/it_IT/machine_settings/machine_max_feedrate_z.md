Maximum Speed Z
====
This setting indicates the highest speed that your printer can reach in the Z direction.

This is used to limit the [Z Hop Speed](../speed/speed_z_hop.md). You can't use a Z hop speed that is greater than the maximum speed your printer can take.

**Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.**
