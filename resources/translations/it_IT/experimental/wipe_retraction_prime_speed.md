Wipe Retraction Prime Speed
====
This setting configures how fast the material is primed after the wiping procedure. This can be configured separately from the ordinary [retraction prime speed](../travel/retraction_prime_speed.md).

Priming more slowly can cause a small blob to appear in the location where the nozzle lands after the wiping procedure. However priming more slowly might be necessary to get the material flowing properly after a longer retraction for the wiping procedure.
