Draft Shield X/Y Distance
====
This setting configures how far from the print the draft shield will be printed.

The farther the draft shield is located from your print, the less effective it will be at keeping the temperature within the draft shield constant. There will be more air flowing around the print then, so the print is less protected against air currents.

However printing the draft shield farther from the print can also have a positive effect on the cooling of your print since it allows the fans on the print head to properly blow onto your print.

In addition, placing the draft shield farther from the object will take more space. You can't print it any farther from your object than your build volume allows.
