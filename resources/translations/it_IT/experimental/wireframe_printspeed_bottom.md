WP Bottom Printing Speed
====
This setting configures the printing speed of the concentric rings on the initial layer of the print when using Wire Printing. The printing speed of the initial flat layer can be configured separately from the rest of the horizontal layers.

For the first flat layer, the wire printing technique won't need to bridge. Depending on the solidifying properties of your material and the fan speeds of your printer, the bottom speed may be printed a little slower than the rest of the flat layers.
