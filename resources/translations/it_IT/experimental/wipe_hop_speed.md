Wipe Hop Speed
====
This setting configures how fast the nozzle is moved up - or the build plate is moved down - when performing the Z hop for the wiping procedure. This can be configured separately from the ordinary [Z hop speed](../speed/speed_z_hop.md).

When adjusting the [Z hop height](wipe_hop_amount.md), you may want to adjust the speed as well in order to cope with the extra distance that needs to be traversed. Keep in mind though that the greater distance also allows for greater movement speed due to acceleration. Previously the maximum speed may not be reached at all due to limits on acceleration.
