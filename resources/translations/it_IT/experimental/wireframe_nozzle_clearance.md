WP Nozzle Clearance
====
This setting simply adjusts the distance between the vertical struts of the saw-tooth pattern of Wire Printing. It makes the pattern wider than it is tall, with the premise of leaving space for the nozzle to crawl down to the previous horizontal ring.

Normally, the saw-tooth pattern contains a diagonal that is exactly diagonal at 45Â°. The height of the teeth is exactly the same as the width. This setting increases the width of these teeth. As a result, the diagonal line will be printed more shallowly.

Increasing this setting reduces the amount of connections between the horizontal rings of the wire frame. This makes the frame weaker, but slightly reduces the print time. If the nozzle is very wide and shallow, this setting can be used to prevent the nozzle from hitting the adjacent teeth.
