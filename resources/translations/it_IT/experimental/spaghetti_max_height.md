Spaghetti Infill Maximum Height
====
With this setting, you can configure how frequent the steps will occur, if the spaghetti infill is [stepped](spaghetti_infill_stepped.md).

Producing the spaghetti infill with more steps allows the spaghetti to be more uniformly distributed across the infill volume. The material will be able to spread out into the creases of the model. If the spaghetti infill is intended for producing flexible infill, this prevents weak spots in the infill. If the spaghetti infill is used to cast as infill material, the infill will not have as many air pockets.

However, increasing the amount of steps will take more time to print. The print head has to make more motions and if the infill is printed with a different extruder, the tools have to be switched more often.
