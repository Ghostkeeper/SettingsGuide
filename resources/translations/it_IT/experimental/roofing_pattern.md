Top Surface Skin Pattern
====
This setting allows you to choose a different pattern for the very topmost layers indicated by the [Top Surface Skin Layers](../top_bottom/roofing_layer_count.md) setting than the rest of the top and bottom.

Only the top layer(s) of the skin will get drawn in this pattern.

The function of this setting is mostly cosmetic. While some options for the [Top/Bottom Pattern](../top_bottom/top_bottom_pattern.md) setting will have different impact on strength or water tightness, the impact of the very topmost layer on this is minimal. Instead you may choose a different pattern that looks better for your part. For instance, you may want to choose the concentric pattern for circular objects.
