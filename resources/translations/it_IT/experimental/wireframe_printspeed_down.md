WP Downward Printing Speed
====
This setting specifies how fast the nozzle will move down while making a diagonal motion in the saw-tooth pattern. The speed of moving downwards can be configured separately from the rest of the wire printing speed.

Moving down slower will take more time, but gives the material more time to solidify. This makes the print more reliable.
