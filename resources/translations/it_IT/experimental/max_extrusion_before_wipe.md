Material Volume Between Wipes
====
In addition to wiping at every layer, you may also just want to wipe after having printed a certain amount of material. This setting configures the amount of material that may be extruded between wipes. If a layer contains more material than that, a wipe may be initiated halfway through a layer.

The advantage of wiping at every layer change is that there will be a seam at the layer change anyway. This is an opportune moment to move the nozzle away from the print, since it won't create an additional seam. However if a layer contains too much extrusion (as is often the case for layers containing a lot of skin) then the material could still bunch up on the nozzle. For those cases, setting a maximum extruded material between wipes can help to keep the nozzle clean.

**This setting was never implemented. It has no effect on the print at all.**
