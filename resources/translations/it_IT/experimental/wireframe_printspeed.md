WP Speed
====
This setting configures the overall movement speed of the print head at every stage of the Wire Printing process. The speed can be adjusted separately for the [upwards](wireframe_printspeed_up.md), [downwards](wireframe_printspeed_down.md) and [horizontal](wireframe_printspeed_flat.md) motions, as well as the horizontal motions on the [first layer](wireframe_printspeed_bottom.md). This setting (by default) influences all of those speeds.

Increasing the print speed makes the print take less time. However, it will also increase vibrations and reduce the accuracy of the nozzle's motions. The reliability of Wire Printing is mostly dependent on the strength of connections. Increasing the speed reduces the chance that two points in the frame connect together properly.
