Nozzle Switch Retract Speed
====
While a nozzle is on stand-by, the material is kept out of the heat zone to protect it from degrading. This setting configures how fast the material is retracted from the nozzle chamber when switching to a different extruder.

Since the retraction for the extruder switch is longer, this setting can be configured separately from the [speed of ordinary retractions](../travel/retraction_retract_speed.md). Increasing the setting can reduce oozing, but has a chance of grinding the filament which may cause the feeder to lose grip on the filament.
