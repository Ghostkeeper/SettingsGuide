![The Y coordinate of the prime tower](../images/prime_tower.svg)

Note that these coordinates don't indicate the centre of the prime tower, but the corner with the lowest X and Y coordinates. The coordinates of the prime tower are the g-code coordinates, which is different from the coordinates in which Cura shows the model positions. Where the prime tower will end up is indicated on the build plate with a circular shadow, indicating that other objects can't be placed there.
