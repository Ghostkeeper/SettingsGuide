Nozzle Switch Retraction Distance
====
When printing with multiple extruders, the extruders that aren't currently printing will be held on stand-by. The material must be retracted out of the heat zone completely while they are on stand-by, because they will get a lot of time to ooze otherwise.

This setting determines how far the material for this extruder is retracted when the extruder goes into stand-by during an extruder switch. It can be configured separately from the [ordinary retraction distance](../travel/retraction_amount.md), because usually the distance to retract is much greater to ensure that the material doesn't keep oozing and degrading in the nozzle chamber while the other extruders are printing.
