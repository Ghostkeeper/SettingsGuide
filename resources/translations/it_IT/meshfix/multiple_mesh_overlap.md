Merged Meshes Overlap
====
This setting creates an overlap where two models meet. As a result, the two meshes will stick to each other much better.

This is useful for prints with multiple different materials. Typically the models for multi-colour prints will be designed to match each other precisely. Printing them like that will not make them still well to each other. It is better to let them overlap slightly so that the prints can interweave.

Increase this setting to improve strength. However, increasing it too much will cause overextrusion, which makes the surface less pretty and can cause the print to be knocked over. Increasing it will also cause the border between the models to blur, so the colour in multi-colour prints will not be as precise.
