Default Z Jerk
====
This setting indicates the jerk rate that your firmware uses for the Z direction, if Cura is not [controlling the jerk](../speed/jerk_enabled.md) of the print.

This is used to obtain correct time estimates for your print if Cura is not controlling the jerk rates. The entire print will use the same jerk rate then.

*Since this is a machine setting, this setting is not normally visible in the settings list.*
