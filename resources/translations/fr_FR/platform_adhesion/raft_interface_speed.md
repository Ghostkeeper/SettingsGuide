Vitesse d’impression du milieu du radeau
===

This setting configures the speed at which the middle layer of the raft is printed. The speed of the middle layer can be configured separately from the speed of the top and base layers.

Printing the middle layer more slowly keeps the material hot for longer, which reduces internal stresses. This reduces warping once the material cools down. However printing more slowly also takes more time.
