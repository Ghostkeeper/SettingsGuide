Vitesse d’impression du dessus du radeau
===

This setting configures the speed at which the top layers of the raft are printed. The speed of the top layers can be configured separately from the speed of the middle and base layers.

Printing the top layers more slowly keeps the material hot for longer, which reduces internal stresses and warping. It will also allow the nozzle to heat up adjacent raft lines to smooth them out more. This creates a smoother surface for the raft and as a result also a smoother surface for your print.

This comes at the cost of added printing time. Since there are often more than one top layers, the effect of speed on printing time for the top layers is bigger than the base and middle layers.
