This setting configures the fan speed while printing the base layer of the raft. The fan speed while printing the base layer can be configured separately from the middle and top layers.

Configuring the fan speed for the base layer separately is useful since reducing the fan speed can improve bed adhesion and reduce warping. Increasing the fan speed can improve the smoothness of the surface of the raft, but that is not a concern for the base layer. Because of this, it's useful to set the fan speed a bit lower than in the top layers.
