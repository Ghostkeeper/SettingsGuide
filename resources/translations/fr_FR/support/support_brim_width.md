This setting adjusts the width of the support brim. With a wider support brim, more contours will be drawn inside the support area to give better adhesion.

A wider brim will increase the adhesion of the support to the build plate and reduce warping of support. As a result, the support will stand more sturdily, which improves reliability of the print.
