This setting controls the fan speed during the printing of the skin of the third layer above a bridge. This fan speed overrides the normal [fan speed](../cooling/cool_fan_speed.md) that would otherwise be used.

If the [fan speed](bridge_fan_speed.md) was increased for the first and second bridge layers, you'll most likely also want to increase the fan speed for the third layer. This cools the material more quickly which causes it to lean less on the previous layer. There are really no significant downsides. In theory, increasing the fan speed too much would cause the layers to bond too weakly, compromising strength. However the layers already bond very weakly during a bridge so there is very little strength that can be gained from reducing the fan speed.

However for some high-temperature materials, turning the fan up high can cause underextrusion or even complete clogging of the nozzle.
