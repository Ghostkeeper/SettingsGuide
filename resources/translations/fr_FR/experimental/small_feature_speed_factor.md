Contours that are shorter than the [Small Feature Max Length](small_feature_max_length.md) can be printed at a reduced speed. With this setting, you can indicate the speed at which these contours should be printed, as a factor of their [normal printing speed](../speed/speed_wall.md).

During the printing of small holes, the bead tends to get pulled along with the nozzle into the corner. If the corner is very sharp, as with small holes, this has the effect of making the hole smaller. When printing more slowly, this pull is reduced because the material has more time to settle in and because the mechanical pull is simply lower.

Reducing the speed for these small features will make the dimensions more accurate. However it will also increase the printing time slightly. Luckily, since these contours are small by definition, the total added print time is not usually very significant.
