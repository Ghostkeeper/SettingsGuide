While printing the downward diagonal motion of the saw-tooth pattern for Wire Printing, the material tends to get dragged along a bit. This setting compensates for that effect by transforming the shape of the saw-tooth pattern slightly. The tips of the teeth are brought upwards and back.

The tips of the teeth are moved exactly opposite of the diagonal downward motion. As the material gets dragged along, hopefully the tips of the saw-tooth pattern end up in its intended location.

When tuned well, this makes the saw-tooth pattern print more accurately. As a result, the next horizontal ring that gets placed on top of the saw-tooth pattern will not sag as much as it would otherwise. The entire structure becomes stronger and the print will be more reliable.
