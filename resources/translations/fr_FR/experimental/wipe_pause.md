With this setting, the nozzle can be made to pause briefly just after the end of the wiping procedure.

The wiping procedure is long enough for one moving movement. The nozzle moves to the side of the building volume and makes a back and forth movement, and then must return to the printing. During this time there will be a lot of oozing and a [longer retraction](wipe_retraction_amount.md) may be necessary. After retraction, there will be a period of time after which the flow from the nozzle will still have to start. This pause allows the nozzle chamber to return to pressure when the material is not retracted again, allowing the first line to be printed correctly without significant under-extrusion.

A pause that is too long will cause a drop to appear at the nozzle location. Depending on the [print order](../infill/infill_before_walls.md), this may not be significant because the spot may appear inside the print where it is not visible. However, the material used for this spot will not be used for the following printed lines, resulting in under-extrusion at this location. This setting requires careful adjustment.
