This setting is another compensation factor that can be applied to compensate for the sagging of the material during Wire Printing. Instead of directly moving diagonally downwards for the saw-tooth pattern, this setting will make the nozzle go horizontal for a specified length of wire and then move on downwards.

The straight horizontal motion is intended to pull the material upwards slightly before moving down. If tuned correctly, this makes the material go down in a straight diagonal rather than in a sagged curve. This makes the saw-tooth pattern stronger and also makes the tips of the teeth stand up better to support the next horizontal ring.
