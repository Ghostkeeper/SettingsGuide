How fast the print head can accelerate towards the desired velocity when starting, stopping or changing direction. Just like a car, the print head needs to accelerate in order to change its speed or direction.

Increasing acceleration causes the print head to reach the desired speed and direction sooner. This will make the print faster, especially when printing small parts, but will also cause more vibrations. These vibrations reduce dimensional accuracy and cause ringing.
