    "img_description" : "This image illustrates a cross section of the feeder, with the 'maximum retraction count' indicated.",
    "hints" : "- The benefit of maximizing the amount of retractions is that it decreases the possibility of grinding.\n- However, for models with a lot of holes (e.g. a voronoi print), this can lead to stringing if the value is too low."
